# The Orchestrator

For you, the User, Stratum removes the complexity of "System Administration." You don't manage servers; you manage Capabilities.

## How it Works

1. Own Your Identity (Domain Space):
You log into your domain registrar (e.g., Namecheap). This is your "Dashboard." Here, you pick the apps you want (e.g., a Blog, a Store, a Portfolio).

2. Rent Your Power (Hosting Provider):
You pick a hosting provider separately (e.g., AWS). You simply copy an API Key from AWS into your Namecheap dashboard.

3. The Magic:
Your Domain Space tells AWS what to run.

- Want more power? Increase your budget in AWS.
- AWS too expensive? Sign up for Azure, paste the new key, and flip the "Migrate" switch.

## Benefits

- No Vendor Lock-in: Your data and app settings live with your Domain, not the Host. Moving from Amazon to Google is as easy as changing a DNS record.

- Simple Budgeting: Set a hard cap (e.g., "Don't spend more than $10/month").

- One Dashboard: Manage all your apps, emails, and services in one place, even if they run on five different servers around the world.
