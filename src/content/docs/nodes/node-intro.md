title: For Hosting Providers
description: The role of Compute Hosts (AWS, Azure, etc.) in the Stratum Framework.

# The Power Plant

Hosting Providers (AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean, or even local ISPs) are the engines of the Stratum ecosystem. In this framework, your role is simplified: you provide raw compute and storage capacity on demand.

You do not need to build complex UIs or "App Stores." You simply execute the workloads sent to you by Domain Providers.

## Your Responsibilities

1. Run the Stratum Shim:
You run the open-source Stratum Connector on your hardware. This software listens for incoming "App Manifests" from Domain Providers.

2. Resource Allocation:
When a Manifest arrives, you spin up the requested containers.
    - Budgeting: You respect the user's "Resource Budget" (e.g., $20/mo). If usage hits this cap, you throttle or alert, based on policy.

3. Stateless Execution:
Stratum containers are designed to be mobile. You provide CPU and RAM. Persistent data should be stored in standardized storage buckets (Stratum Storage) that you also host, but which are easily detachable.

## The Business Model

- Commoditized Compute: You compete on price, performance, and reliability.

- Self-Reported Licensing: As part of the Stratum commercial license, you calculate the revenue generated by Stratum workloads and remit a small percentage to the Stratum foundation/organization.
