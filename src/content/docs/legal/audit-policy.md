To ensure fairness across the ecosystem, the Stratum Foundation reserves the right to audit Commercial Hosting Providers.

# 1. The Trigger

Audits are not random. They are typically triggered by:

- Significant discrepancies between reported usage (via public network stats) and reported revenue.
- Whistleblower reports regarding under-reporting.
- Random selection (limited to 5% of providers per year).

## 2. The Process

1. Notification: We will provide 30 days' written notice before an audit begins.
2. The Auditor: We will use a neutral, third-party accounting firm. We will not access your raw user data or trade secrets directly.
3. Scope: The audit is strictly limited to verifying the "Gross Stratum Revenue" figures for the preceding 12 months.

## 3. Outcomes

- Correct Reporting: If the audit confirms your figures (within a 5% margin of error), Stratum Foundation pays the full cost of the audit.
- Under-Reporting: If you have under-paid by more than 5%, you must pay the difference immediately, plus the full cost of the audit.
