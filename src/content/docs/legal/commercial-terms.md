title: Commercial Terms
description: Specifics of the Revenue Share model for Hosting Providers.
---

These terms apply to Commercial Hosting Providers as defined in the Stratum Ecosystem License.

# 1. The Revenue Share Rate

As of February 2026, the Revenue Share Rate is set at:
5% of Gross Stratum Revenue

Calculation Method

"Gross Stratum Revenue" is defined as the total income generated from:
1. Compute fees charged for running Stratum Containers.
2. Storage fees charged for Stratum Storage Buckets.
3. Network egress fees associated with Stratum workloads.

Deductions: You may not deduct operating costs (electricity, hardware depreciation, staff) from this calculation. You may deduct transaction fees (e.g., Stripe/PayPal processing fees) up to a maximum of 3%.

## 2. Self-Reporting Process

To keep overhead low, Stratum operates on a trust-but-verify system.

1. Registration: Providers must register their "Provider ID" with the Stratum Foundation registry.
2. Quarterly Filing:
    - Q1 (Jan-Mar): Due April 15
    - Q2 (Apr-Jun): Due July 15
    - Q3 (Jul-Sep): Due Oct 15
    - Q4 (Oct-Dec): Due Jan 15

3. Submission Format: Reports should be submitted via the Stratum Provider Portal (JSON/CSV format).

## 3. Late Payments

Payments received more than 30 days past the due date may be subject to a late fee of 1.5% per month on the outstanding balance.

## 4. License Termination

Failure to report revenue or remit payments for two consecutive quarters will result in the immediate revocation of your Commercial Hosting License. You will be required to cease all Stratum hosting operations and notify your users to migrate.
