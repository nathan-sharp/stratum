description: Guidelines for using the Stratum name and logo.
---

The "Stratum" name and the Stratum Logo are trademarks of the Stratum Foundation. We want you to build on top of Stratum, but we also need to protect users from confusion.

# You MAY use the Stratum name to:

- Truthfully describe your services (e.g., "Hosting for Stratum Containers," "Stratum-compatible Domain Space").
- Discuss the framework in articles, tutorials, or social media.
- Label your open-source projects (e.g., "Stratum-connector-python").

## You MAY NOT use the Stratum name to:

- Imply official endorsement where none exists (e.g., do not call yourself "The Official Stratum Host" or "Stratum Cloud" without written permission).
- Create confusingly similar brand names (e.g., "StratumHost" or "StratumCloud").
- Use the Stratum logo as your own app icon or business logo.

## "Certified Provider" Badge

Hosting Providers who are fully compliant with the Commercial Terms and have passed a technical verification check are eligible to display the "Stratum Certified Provider" badge on their marketing materials.
